Given an integer, N, print its first 10 multiples. Each mulitple N x i(where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.

Input Format:

	A single integer, N.

Output Format:

	Print 10 lines of output; each line i(where 1 <= i <= 10) contains the result of N x i in the form:<br />
	N x i = result.

Constraints:

	2 <= N <= 20

ex:

	input:
		2

	output:
		2 x 1 = 2
		2 x 2 = 4
		2 x 3 = 6
		2 x 4 = 8
		2 x 5 = 10
		2 x 6 = 12
		2 x 7 = 14
		2 x 8 = 16
		2 x 9 = 18
		2 x 10 = 20
