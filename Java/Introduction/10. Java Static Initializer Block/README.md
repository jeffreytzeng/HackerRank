Static initialization blocks are executed when the class is loaded, and you can initialize static variables in those blocks. Given breadth B and height H of a parallelogram print the area of the parallelogram.

Input Format:

	Two lines of input. First line contains B the second line contains H the breadth and height of the parallelogram.

Output Format:

	Print the area of the parallelogram if both breadth B and height H are greater than zero. Otherwise, print "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.

Constraints:

	-100 <= B, H <= 100

ex1:

	input:
		1
		3

	output:
		3

ex2:

	input:
		-1
		2

	output:
		java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive
