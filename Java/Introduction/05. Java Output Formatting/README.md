Using System.out.printf function to print formatted output.<br />

Input Format:

	Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
	Each String will have a maximum of 10 alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from 0 to 999.

Output Format:

	In each line of output there should be two columns:
	The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly 15 characters.
	The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly 3 digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.

ex:

	input:
		java 100
		cpp 65
		python 50

	output:
		java           100
		cpp            065
		python         050
