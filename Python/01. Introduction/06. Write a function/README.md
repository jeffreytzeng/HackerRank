Given the year, write a function to check if the year is leap or not.
Note: In the Gregorian calendar three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

	The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

Input Format:

	Single integer in a line for the year y to be checked.

Output Format:

	Return True/False in the function.

Constraints:

	1900 <= y <= 10^5

ex:

	input:
		1990

	output:
		False
