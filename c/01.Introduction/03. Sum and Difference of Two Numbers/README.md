Take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and ouput their sum  and difference with each type in a new line.

Input Format:

	The first line contains two integers.
	The second line contains two floating point numbers.

Output Format:

	Print the sum and difference of both integers separated by a space on the first line, and the sum and difference of both float(scaled to 1 decimal place) separated by a space on the second line.

Constraints:

	1 <= int, float <= 10^4

ex:

	input:
		10 4
		4.0 2.0

	output
		14 6
		6.0 2.0
