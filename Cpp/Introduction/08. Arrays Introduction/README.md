You'll be given an array of N integers and you have to print the integers in the reverse order.

Input Format:

	The first line of the input contains N, where N is the number of integers. The next line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:

	Print the N integers of the array in the reverse order in a single line separated by a space.

Constraints:

	1 <= N <= 1000
	1 <= Ai <= 10000, where Ai is the ith integer in the array.

ex:

	input:
