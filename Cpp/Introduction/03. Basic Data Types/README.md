Read each data type with scanf/cin and print each of them with a new line by using printf/cout.
Note: If taking a million numbers as input and printing a million lines, it is faster to use scanf and printf.

Input Format:

	Input consists of the following space-separated values: int, long, char, float, and double, respectively.

Output Format:

	Print each element on a new line in the same order it was received as input. Note that the floating point value should be correct up to 3 decimal places and the double to 9 decimal places.

ex:

	input:
		3 12345678912345 a 334.23 14049.30493

	output:
		3
		12345678912345
		a
		334.230
		14049.304930000
