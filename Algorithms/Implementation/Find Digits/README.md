Given an integer n, for each digit that makes up this integer n whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.

Input Format:

	The first line is an integer, t, indicating the number of test cases.
	The t subsequent lines each contain an integer, n.

Output Format:

	For every test case, count the number of digits in n that are divisors of n. Print each answer on a new line.

Constraints:

	1 <= t <= 15
	0 < n < 10^9
