Laura plants a Utopian tree at the onset of spring with a height of 1 meter, which grows double at spring and 1 meter at summer. How tall will her tree be after n growth cycles?

Input Format:

	The first line contains an integer t, the number of test cases.
	t subsequent lines each contain an integer n, denoting the number of cycles for that case.

Output Format:

	For each test case, print the height of the Utopian tree  after n cycles. Each height must be printed on a new line.

Constraints:

	1 <= t <= 10
	0 <= n <= 60

ex:

	input:
		3
		0
		1
		4

	output:
		1
		2
		7
